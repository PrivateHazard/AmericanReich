 spain.1.t: "The Permanent Temporary Dictatorship"
 spain.1.desc: "The Rif War in the early 1920's devasted Spain with it dividing into 2 sides know as the \"africanistsas\", who wanted to keep fighting the war in the Rif, and the \"abandonistas\" who wanted to leave the Rif and stop the war feeling as it wasn't worth the blood, toil, and treasure. These divisions between the two sides nearly brought the country to the brink of ruin and civil war, but in late 1923, General Miguel Primo de Reveria couped the government, and turned it into what he called a "Temporary Dictatorship", implying it would only last until the problems in Spain were solved. seeing these deep divisions in the nation and managed to quell many divisions by quashing them with an iron boot.\n These measures alone, however, did not win the war in the Rif. Primo de Rivera meet with the Germans and convinced them to aid the Spanish in the Rif allowing them to finally end the war. This victory earned Primo de Rivera great fanfare and allowed Spain to remain stable for several years. However, in 1930 the Great Depression hit Spain unraveling confidence in the Rivera government. The government in panic decided to make a deal with the Germans to decrease the instability in exchange for continued reliance on Germany. With this deal in place it again stabilized the country and earned Rivera fanfare.\n However, times have once again changed for Spain and the country is falling into chaos and discontent with the aging general and his \"Temporary Dictatorship\" and it's only a matter of time before the government collapses."
