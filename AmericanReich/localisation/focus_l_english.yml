 GER_first_vienna_award_desc:0 "The Hungarians were one of the people that suffered worst after the Great War.

The process of moving factory equipment from suburbia deeper into the city, and from rural areas into urban ones has already begin."
 FRA_decentralizetheeconomy:0 "Decentralize the Economy"
 FRA_decentralizetheeconomy_desc:0 "Moving factories outside of our most urban centers and evenly distributing them across the country gives our citizens even further control over the means of production. We should start moving factory equipment as soon as possible."
 FRA_dispersetheunions:0 "Disperse the Unions"
 FRA_dispersetheunions_desc:0 "Instead of centralizing the unions into a small amount of large entities, mostly based in big cities, we should break them up and spread them over the entire nation, it will allow all workers everywhere to have quick and easy access to a union whenever required."
 FRA_allowprivatecorporations:0 "Allow Private Corporations"
 FRA_allowprivatecorporations_desc:0 "A highly controversial decision that managed to somehow be implemented. Reintroducing private corporations has invited capitalism back into the Commune, but, these corporations are strictly managed and must adhere to many laws that make sure the workers are never exploited."
 FRA_syntheticinvestments:0 "Synthetic Investments"
 FRA_syntheticinvestments_desc:0 "Oil is a rare commodity and so is trade in this new world. Not to worry, however, scientists have made breakthroughs in producing our own oil, but they still require funding and time to finalize the projects."
 FRA_programmederechercheinternational:0 "Programme de Recherche International"
 FRA_programmederechercheinternational_desc:0 "A collaborative research effort between the members of the Internationale shall drive the revolution forward all over the world. With them sharing their discoveries, and us doing the same, everyone benefits. Envoys have already been sent to our allies."
 FRA_submarineeffort:0 "Submarine Effort"

 FRA_battleshipeffort:0 "Battleship Effort"
 FRA_battleshipeffort_desc:0 "In order to match the navy of Germany, which has been building up a large navy to support its new empire, we require firepower, not numbers. Researching new battleship models will allow us to catch up."
 FRA_thenewdoctrine:0 "The New Doctrine"
 FRA_thenewdoctrine_desc:0 "Just like the rest of our army, the navy needs to be changed radically as well. We cannot hope to match the Germans on the open seas, however, we can wittle them down with submarines."
 FRA_theolddoctrine:0 "The Old Doctrine"
 FRA_theolddoctrine_desc:0 "Despite common belief, our navy was fine during the first Weltkrieg, and it was our land forces that failed. Maintaining our old doctrine allows us to keep building up without any major changes in course."
 FRA_therevolutionarynavy:0 "The Revolutionary Navy"
 FRA_therevolutionarynavy_desc:0 "In order to make sure our trade runs smoothly and we aren't crippled by tarrifs, or simply invaded from our coasts, we need to maintain a strong navy."

 FRA_groundsupport:0 "Ground Support"

 FRA_vivelacommune_desc:0 "The process of military reforms is finally completed, and we are, to an extent, readier to face the outside world. Vive La Commune!"
 FRA_organizedfront:0 "Organized Front"
 FRA_organizedfront_desc:0 "Assaulting the enemy with a horde of men sounds barbaric and uncoordinated, but it only is so if you make it so. We can prevent disaster by making sure the front stays organized at all times."
 FRA_massproduction:0 "Mass Production"
 FRA_massproduction_desc:0 "Mass mobilization requires a gun in every hand to be fully effective. Most of our military factories should be focused in making said guns."
 FRA_securecommunications:0 "Secure Communications"
 FRA_securecommunications_desc:0 "In order to make use of our plans and our defences, our officers need to be able to coordinate safely, without the enemy being able to pick up on their plans. Securing our communications equipment is the best course of action."

 FRA_massmobilization:0 "Mass Mobilization"
 FRA_massmobilization_desc:0 "The Commune has many men capable of fighting at a moment's notice, and if we want our military to be what it once was, we must mobilize all of them. While we won't have many specialized units and wont particularly excel in any field, a million men with rifles can do a lot more then a hundred with tanks."
 FRA_officersinitiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
 FRA_officersinitiative_desc:0 "Focusing on training capable officers ready of leadership in the field is the obvious next step in our tactical developments, and we mustn't dally."
 FRA_decentralizedcommandstructure:0 "Decentralized Command Structure"
 FRA_decentralizedcommandstructure_desc:0 "A strict chain of command is certainly good for preserving maximum order in the battlefield, however, allowing soldiers to perform actions on the fly without having to constantly report back to command allows them to act and respond faster."
 FRA_blitztactics:0 "Blitz Tactics"
 FRA_blitztactics_desc:0 "Blitzkrieg is a German term referring to rapid assault with tanks and planes, quickly followed up by infantry. If we are going forward with tanks already, there is no point in not adopting this method."
 FRA_armoredbreakthrough:0 "Armored Breakthrough"
 FRA_armoredbreakthrough_desc:0 "Tanks, while costly, are incredibly powerful if used correctly and could prove invaluable in breaking through German defensive lines. Our focus should be on their production."

 FRA_demandalsace_desc:0 "Alsace Lorraine has been not been taken from us, it has been stolen as a consequence of the Weltkrieg. It shall no longer lie in German hands. They WILL return it to us - this is not a request, it is an order, and they know what the alternative is."
 FRA_militarybuildup:0 "Military Build Up"
 FRA_militarybuildup_desc:0 "We can, for a short wihle, heavily invest in military industry. This will allow us to build up at least a staging ground for further expansion, but can be done only so long, as the money is needed elsewhere."
 FRA_theroadtorevolution:0 "The Road to Revolution"
 FRA_theroadtorevolution_desc:0 "Should we wish to spread the revolution, or at the very least keep it alive in France, we require significant military buildup - to make sure no harm can come to us, and to make sure we can strike when necessary."

 FRA_controltherevolution:0 "Control the Revolution"

 FRA_managetheinfrastructure:0 "Manage the Infrastructure"
 FRA_managetheinfrastructure_desc:0 "Our infrastructure is, all things considered, fairly well developed. However, there is always room left to improve, and perhaps, during times of war, we will need to build railways and supply lines on the fly if the ones already in place prove inadequate. Educating our engineers on how to further improve our infrastructure would be a step in the right direction."
 FRA_miningoperations:0 "Mining Operations"
 FRA_miningoperations_desc:0 "Expanding our mines so that we may further use our resources is necessary both for our civilian and military industry."
 FRA_thecommuneselections:0 "The Commune's Government"

 FRA_standardizethewages_desc:0 "While it is true that different jobs require a different amount of labor, there still remains a wealth disparity in our nation. Equalizing the wages of all jobs might not be possible, but standardizing them in accordance to what kind of work the people are being payed for certainly is."
 FRA_calibratetheeconomy:0 "Calibrate the Economy"
 FRA_calibratetheeconomy_desc:0 "Chances are, should we take military action, there will be tarrifs and blockades. We need to be economically prepared for this. Calibrating certain aspects of our economy is a decent start."
