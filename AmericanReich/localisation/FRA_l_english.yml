 FRA_centralizetheunions:0 "Centralize the Unions"
 FRA_centralizetheunions_desc:0 "The Unions should act as a collective - with smaller ones being absorbed into bigger ones, or smaller ones forming larger unions. This gives them more control, and gives us more control over them. In either case, everyone wins."
 FRA_socialistdemocracy:0 "Socialist Democracy"
 FRA_socialistdemocracy_desc:0 "A socialist democracy is the best of both worlds - government control and planning where required, but civil liberties in other places. Truly, a good system. We must make sure it is implemented in our country."
 FRA_fraternit:0 "Fraternité"
 FRA_fraternit_desc:0 "A militaristic and more authoritarian government has recently seized power, and seeks to spread the revolution. Viva la Revolucion!"

 FRA_hydroelectricplants:0 "Hydroelectric Plants"
 FRA_hydroelectricplants_desc:0 "France has many large rivers flowing through it all across the country. This provides many opportunities for hydroelectric plants to be built, and the energy they produce is clean and efficient. Funding them is very important for our future."
 FRA_improveinfrastructure:0 "Improve Infrastructure"
 FRA_improveinfrastructure_desc:0 "Our infrastructure can be improved even further with further efforts. There is nothing to lose - the people and economy both benefit, and so does the country as a whole. Continuing to expand our infrastructure is not urgent, but it would be beneficial to do so soon."
 FRA_increasefrenchweaponproduction:0 "Increase French Weapon Production"
 FRA_increasefrenchweaponproduction_desc:0 "A fully self reliant war machine cannot be toppled. Our own factories, producing our own guns, made by our hands can produce as much as we need, whenever we need. We must strive for this goal."
 FRA_approvethearmstrade:0 "Approve the Arms Trade"
 FRA_approvethearmstrade_desc:0 "Buying weapons from other countries, while not our first choice, could be beneficial if we are building up or army or require quick replacements during a time of war. If we are to take this route, we must do so quickly, so we can ensure that we will large stockpiles of army equipment when the time comes."
 FRA_thecommuneseducation:0 "The Commune's Education"
 FRA_thecommuneseducation_desc:0 "We must fund education for our people, as it is very important for furthering our nation industrially and economically, as educated works are better then uneducated workers. However, should we wish so, we could always teach them about our ideology and history - rewritten, of course."

 FRA_theproductionquestion_desc:0 "While in theory all of this is highly effective, there is a large issue about production that needs to be resolved..."
 FRA_galit:0 "Égalité"
 FRA_galit_desc:0 "A moderate government, focused on equality of the nation and the people has been recently voted in. Hopefully, this will help preserve the status quo."
 FRA_thecommunestrade:0 "The Commune's Trade"
 FRA_thecommunestrade_desc:0 "Up until now, trade was spontaneous and done as needed, and while that has given us some benefits, we require a concrete policy - either we should work on self-sufficiency, or open up to the rest of the world."
 FRA_socialistdoctrine:0 "Socialist Indoctrination"
 FRA_socialistdoctrine_desc:0 "Teaching the people about syndicalism, socialism, and all manner of revolutionary systems is the new way forward. Giving them a revolutionary spirit and beliefs to cling to, we will grow stronger as a nation."
 FRA_technologicalfocus:0 "Technological Focus"
 FRA_technologicalfocus_desc:0 "Despite how it may seem, the people of France believe in its nation well enough, and we do not require mass political indoctrination of the youth. However, we do need skilled workers and professionals - researchers, engineers, and mechanics. Schools should serve as a pathway to a better future, not indoctrination."
 FRA_raisesupportforsocialism:0 "Socialist Textbooks"
 FRA_raisesupportforsocialism_desc:0 "While we certainly cannot stop people from learning about history or social studies, we can alter and redact parts that show us in a negative light, while putting a focus on our great accomplishments."
 FRA_unionizetheschools:0 "Unionize the Schools"
 FRA_unionizetheschools_desc:0 "Not only workers require unions, students do as well. From now on, we will allow, and even encourage school unions so that the students, just like the adults, are able to voice their demands and critiques as one entity. Isn't that just marvelous?"
 FRA_thecommuneseconomy:0 "The Commune's Economy"
 FRA_thecommuneseconomy_desc:0 "While we have certainly recovered from the Weltkrieg, our industry has not been expanded much, and to an extent, our economy has stagnated. A series of reforms is long overdue."
 FRA_tradewithinthecommune:0 "Trade within the Commune"
 FRA_tradewithinthecommune_desc:0 "Our lands have all the resources we need, and we should focus on being independent from the rest of the world. Given some time and increased efforts, we can accomplish this goal."
 FRA_frenchrevanchism:0 "French Revanchism"
 FRA_frenchrevanchism_desc:0 "Alsace-Lorraine has always been French, will remain French, and must be owned by the great nation of France, at any cost. Or at least, thats what they teach in schools now. Most parts of the educational system now focus on the revolution, the need to reclaim our lost territories, and so on. While not a bad thing, it leaves little room for technological studies..."
 FRA_socialisttechnologicalinstitutes:0 "Socialist Technological Institutes"

 FRA_frenchautarcie:0 "French Autarcie"
 FRA_frenchautarcie_desc:0 "A French Autarky is within our grasp, and with it comes a France more prepared for outside threats. It would certainly be bad if during a time of war, our war machine was at the mercy of foreign nations."
 FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "Ruralism refers to the process of making an area more rural. Country wide ruralization would give us a better use of the space and resources in the entire country.

 FRA_therevolutionarywareconomy:0 "The Revolutionary War Economy"
 FRA_therevolutionarywareconomy_desc:0 "The Revolution must be spread beyond our nation, and our economy should reflect this. Many useless civilian oriented factories have been seized to be used for weapons production. This will lead us forward."
 FRA_revolutionaryeconomy:0 "Revolutionary Economy"
 FRA_revolutionaryeconomy_desc:0 "A revolutionary economy is a modern one, and a one that will allow us to further the revolution without us majorly sacrificing parts of it. At first, we must catch up to the more developed economies, like, for example, Germany's. Then, we must ready ourselves to spread the revolution as far as we can."
 FRA_marketsocialism:0 "Market Socialism"
 FRA_marketsocialism_desc:0 "Market Socialism presents a balance between a planned and a free economy. While it does introduce some of the ills of a free market, those can be managed, and in return the people will have access to a (somewhat) free economy."

 FRA_directionoftheeconomy_desc:0 "The economy, for better of for worse, will at one point require reforms. There are many paths to take, but regardless of which one we choose, it will affect our nation for a long, long time. We must be careful and considerate."
 FRA_exportfrenchculture:0 "Export French Culture"

 FRA_exportsocialism:0 "Export Socialism"
 FRA_exportsocialism_desc:0 "We can always take it a step further and export socialism - help establish unions in foreign countries, sell domestic socialist works and literature, and so much more. It benefits both us and them to spread our ideals to the outside world. Not to mention, theres also money to make in this, money we certainly need."
 FRA_socialistinvestments:0 "Socialist Investments"
 FRA_socialistinvestments_desc:0 "By investing in foreign unions, as well as certain companies, we can gain certain benefits to our industry and economy from abroad."
 FRA_increasefrenchresources:0 "Increase French Resources"

 FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
 FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Decreasing our involvement in the economy is the best course of action, and setting up, as well as encouraging cooperatives around the country is a good stepping stone for the future. After all, can the people truly be free with government control?"

 FRA_decreaseunemployment_desc:0 "Sadly, despite our best efforts, unemployement is still an issue in our country. This is a problem that simply must be overcome as soon as possible, whether by helping people get jobs easier, or assigning them jobs ourselves."
 FRA_reformthetradeunions:0 "Reform the Trade Unions"
 FRA_reformthetradeunions_desc:0 "While we have made efforts in making the unions more organized, many of us, and even some of them say that the current system of organization is ineffective and slow. With their permission and oversight, we will work on creating more effective unions."
 FRA_modernfarming:0 "Modern Farming"
 FRA_modernfarming_desc:0 "Farmers provide invaluable food to the entire Commune. However, they use different farming methods, different types of machines, and the yield they get is not always the same. To ensure a more stable and efficient agricultural base, farming equipment and methods around the country should be modernized."
 FRA_centralizeindustry:0 "Centralize Industry"
 FRA_centralizeindustry_desc:0 "Centralizing the economy in key parts of France would greatly reduce the distance and cost of transferring goods between different factories. The process of moving factory equipment from suburbia deeper into the city, and from rural areas into urban ones has already begin."
 FRA_decentralizetheeconomy:0 "Decentralize the Economy"
 FRA_decentralizetheeconomy_desc:0 "Moving factories outside of our most urban centers and evenly distributing them across the country gives our citizens even further control over the means of production. We should start moving factory equipment as soon as possible."
 FRA_dispersetheunions:0 "Disperse the Unions"
 FRA_dispersetheunions_desc:0 "Instead of centralizing the unions into a small amount of large entities, mostly based in big cities, we should break them up and spread them over the entire nation, it will allow all workers everywhere to have quick and easy access to a union whenever required."
 FRA_allowprivatecorporations:0 "Allow Private Corporations"
 FRA_allowprivatecorporations_desc:0 "A highly controversial decision that managed to somehow be implemented. Reintroducing private corporations has invited capitalism back into the Commune, but, these corporations are strictly managed and must adhere to many laws that make sure the workers are never exploited."
 FRA_syntheticinvestments:0 "Synthetic Investments"
 FRA_syntheticinvestments_desc:0 "Oil is a rare commodity and so is trade in this new world. Not to worry, however, scientists have made breakthroughs in producing our own oil, but they still require funding and time to finalize the projects."
 FRA_programmederechercheinternational:0 "Programme de Recherche International"
 FRA_programmederechercheinternational_desc:0 "A collaborative research effort between the members of the Internationale shall drive the revolution forward all over the world. With them sharing their discoveries, and us doing the same, everyone benefits. Envoys have already been sent to our allies."
 FRA_submarineeffort:0 "Submarine Effort"

 FRA_torpedotechnology:0 "Torpedo Technology"
 FRA_torpedotechnology_desc:0 "Torpedoes, no matter their strength, are flawed in many ways. With some research, those flaws can be remedied."
 FRA_battleshipeffort:0 "Battleship Effort"
 FRA_battleshipeffort_desc:0 "In order to match the navy of Germany, which has been building up a large navy to support its new empire, we require firepower, not numbers. Researching new battleship models will allow us to catch up."
 FRA_thenewdoctrine:0 "The New Doctrine"
 FRA_thenewdoctrine_desc:0 "Just like the rest of our army, the navy needs to be changed radically as well. We cannot hope to match the Germans on the open seas, however, we can wittle them down with submarines."
 FRA_theolddoctrine:0 "The Old Doctrine"
 FRA_theolddoctrine_desc:0 "Despite common belief, our navy was fine during the first Weltkrieg, and it was our land forces that failed. Maintaining our old doctrine allows us to keep building up without any major changes in course."
 FRA_therevolutionarynavy:0 "The Revolutionary Navy"
 FRA_therevolutionarynavy_desc:0 "In order to make sure our trade runs smoothly and we aren't crippled by tarrifs, or simply invaded from our coasts, we need to maintain a strong navy."
 FRA_strategicdestruction:0 "Strategic Destruction"
 FRA_strategicdestruction_desc:0 "Bleeding out our enemies industry by constant bombing is a sure way to cripple their war effort. Focusing on bombers will allow us to do this easily enough."

 FRA_casdevelopment_desc:0 "We can develop our Close Air Support even further by giving research grants to certain military contractors, which we fully plan on doing."
 FRA_aviationtraining:0 "Aviation Training"
 FRA_aviationtraining_desc:0 "Training efforts should be greatly increased. The more experienced pilots we have, the better off we are when the time comes."
 FRA_groundsupport:0 "Ground Support"
 FRA_groundsupport_desc:0 "Planes should mostly fill the role of close air support, helping our troops on the ground during advances or assaults. Recently, our scientists have made a few breakthroughs in this department."
 FRA_vivelacommune:0 "Vive la Commune!"
 FRA_vivelacommune_desc:0 "The process of military reforms is finally completed, and we are, to an extent, readier to face the outside world. Vive La Commune!"
 FRA_organizedfront:0 "Organized Front"
 FRA_organizedfront_desc:0 "Assaulting the enemy with a horde of men sounds barbaric and uncoordinated, but it only is so if you make it so. We can prevent disaster by making sure the front stays organized at all times."
 FRA_massproduction:0 "Mass Production"
 FRA_massproduction_desc:0 "Mass mobilization requires a gun in every hand to be fully effective. Most of our military factories should be focused in making said guns."
 FRA_securecommunications:0 "Secure Communications"
 FRA_securecommunications_desc:0 "In order to make use of our plans and our defences, our officers need to be able to coordinate safely, without the enemy being able to pick up on their plans. Securing our communications equipment is the best course of action."

 FRA_superiorfirepower:0 "Superior Firepower"

 FRA_massmobilization:0 "Mass Mobilization"
 FRA_massmobilization_desc:0 "The Commune has many men capable of fighting at a moment's notice, and if we want our military to be what it once was, we must mobilize all of them. While we won't have many specialized units and wont particularly excel in any field, a million men with rifles can do a lot more then a hundred with tanks."
 FRA_officersinitiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
 FRA_officersinitiative_desc:0 "Focusing on training capable officers ready of leadership in the field is the obvious next step in our tactical developments, and we mustn't dally."
 FRA_decentralizedcommandstructure:0 "Decentralized Command Structure"
 FRA_decentralizedcommandstructure_desc:0 "A strict chain of command is certainly good for preserving maximum order in the battlefield, however, allowing soldiers to perform actions on the fly without having to constantly report back to command allows them to act and respond faster."
 FRA_blitztactics:0 "Blitz Tactics"
 FRA_blitztactics_desc:0 "Blitzkrieg is a German term referring to rapid assault with tanks and planes, quickly followed up by infantry. If we are going forward with tanks already, there is no point in not adopting this method."
 FRA_armoredbreakthrough:0 "Armored Breakthrough"
 FRA_armoredbreakthrough_desc:0 "Tanks, while costly, are incredibly powerful if used correctly and could prove invaluable in breaking through German defensive lines. Our focus should be on their production."

 FRA_demandalsace:0 "Demand Alsace"

 FRA_managetheinfrastructure_desc:0 "Our infrastructure is, all things considered, fairly well developed. However, there is always room left to improve, and perhaps, during times of war, we will need to build railways and supply lines on the fly if the ones already in place prove inadequate. Educating our engineers on how to further improve our infrastructure would be a step in the right direction."

 FRA_calibratetheeconomy:0 "Calibrate the Economy"
 FRA_calibratetheeconomy_desc:0 "Chances are, should we take military action, there will be tarrifs and blockades. We need to be economically prepared for this. Calibrating certain aspects of our economy is a decent start."
