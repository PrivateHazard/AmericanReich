The year is 1936, nearly a hundred years since the Texas revolution where Texas
became independent from Mexico. Soon, after their victory against the Mexicans and
independence acheived, they joined the United States in 1845, however this did not
last very as in late 1860 South Carolina seceded from the United States and soon in
the next year in 1861, Civil War broke out in the United States between the Unionists
and the Confederates who wanted to form the Confederate States of America. The two sides
of the war fought hard for several months with the Confederates winning many of the battles
while a series of incompetent Union generals kept a defensive stance and consistantly
losing battles to the Southerners. Soon, the Main Confederate General Robert E. Lee,
devised a Plan called Special Order 191 allowing the Confederate to march far quicker
into Nothern Territory and winning the Battle of Gettysburg in later 1862. With this
victory, the treaty of Gettysburg was signed by President Abraham Lincoln in early 1863,
which granted the CSA independence and the territory of Arrizona. The Republican party soon
faded into obscurity due to the major loss in the war and failure to achieve its abolitionalist
goal. Over time, the CSA and USA relations quickly deteriorated and many in the United States
called for the reintegration of the South back into the US. Eventually, the CSA was forced to
give up slavery by its allies Britain and France, and soon its Economy collapsed, and had to
slowly be invested in by its allies. In the US, a revanchist President Theodore Roosevelt
is elected in 1912 calls for reclaimation and closer ties to their ally Germany, and soon
the first Weltkrieg begins. Over a period of 5 years the war is fought leading to a Central
Powers victory. Now, in the present, the losers of the War are resentful for their losses in
the war, which begins the culmination of a dark cloud over the world. This, is American Reich:
Southern Victory.
